# Website-Rating
A machine learning model that could learn ratings of websites, provided by the user and predict future values. The model learns the website rating pattern using linear regression. This model is useful to give insights to the website developers regarding the ratings of the websites, even before they create it.
This project also results various data analysis by learning the statistical parameters (OLS Regression Results, Error, Efficiency, Mean, etc.) of the dataset.

## Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a statistical approach for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables.

### Steps in Linear Regression:
1. Plot the points (x, y)
2. Sample Regression line (y = mx + c)
3. Create a best fit line (A best fit line is the one that minimizes that error i.e. it should have minimum difference between the actual and predicted values)
